# Project SO 2020 UBI

Final Project Operating Systems.

Students: Diogo Lavareda and Paulo Silva

Teachers: Paul Crocker and Valderi Leithardt

## 1st Milestone
An operational version of the application is available in the "1a entrega" folder for preview for the teachers.

As indicated in the report:

Currently the project executes the functions both through the commands read from control.txt and through the debugging console. Performs the correct reading of the various files indicated in the statement and sends them to corresponding data structures. The programs are loaded into memory sequentially, and instructions for a new program are loaded immediately after the last address used. So far the only scheduling algorithm implemented is FCFS.

## 2nd Milestone
Edit: SFJ algoritm is now implemented on the scheduler simulator.

2nd part of the work (memory management) is available in the "2a entrega" folder. We have implemented the first-fit and worst-fit algoritm.

## Usage
In both milestones the programs are compiled with the name "main" and the various files for its execution are included0
```bash
./main
```
## NOTE
The "1st attempt" folder was out 1st approach to the problem that turned out to be an inadequate one. So we decided to keep the files in a seperate folder to show the teachers the work that has been done in the implementation of this project other than only the final version.
